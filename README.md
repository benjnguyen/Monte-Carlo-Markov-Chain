# Purpose of this repository
This repository will provide material that has been omitted from a written document on a math project (such as .gif files and code).

# Monte Carlo Markov Chain - Ising Model
The Ising Model is a model that tries to capture the properties of interacting particle systems, namely in ferromagnetic materials. The model allows us to study topics such as energy, magnetization, and phase transitions. The Metropolis Algorithm (Glauber Dynamics) is an algorithm that simulates the Ising Model in thermodynamic equilibrium, and allows us to study properties of interest within the context of a computer simulation.

# Clustering Algorithms - Wolff Algorithm

The Wolff Algorithm was introduced by Uli Wolff in his 1989 paper titled "Collective Monte Carlo Updating for Spin Systems", which built upon the Swedsens-Wang non-local clustering algorithm. We would like to implement it as it overcomes some of the difficulties facing the single-site algorithm.
